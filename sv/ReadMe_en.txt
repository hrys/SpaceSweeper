    Console Application: Overview of the backend Project
========================================================================

This backend application was created by the AppWizard.

This file summarizes the content of the files comprising the backend application.


backend.vcxproj
    This is the main Visual C++ project file created by the application wizard. This includes information related to the version of Visual C++ that created the file as well as the project features, structure, and platform selected in the application wizard.

backend.vcxproj.filters
    This is the Visual C++ project filters file created by the application wizard. This file contains information that associates a project’s files and filters with each other. These associations are used by the IDE to indicate that files with the same extension should be grouped under a particular node. (For example, .cpp files are associated with the Source Files filter.)

backend.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header file (backend.pch) and precompiled types file (StdAfx.obj).

Miscellaneous notes:

AppWizard uses “TODO:” comments to indicate source code that must be added or customized by the user.
